Especially compared to the price here in Denmark.',\n","       b\"love watching all the episodes of Dexter, when i first heard about this series i wasnt too sure about watching it. it took me a very long time to start and now wish i had watched it when it first came out.<br /><br />The fact that he kills and more or less gets away with it, in some episodes you sat on edge of your seat thinking OMG he gonna get caught and then he doesn't, he does try stopping but you know yourself he can't. my favorite episode where the Ice Truck killer, that the ending of that was great how he learns he had a brother, but for his brother to be a baddie and that he had to kill him, i think if he hadn't would it have been different. Oh and The Bay Harbour Butcher, in this it made you think oh no he gonna get caught but he didn't<br /><br />In all ive enjoyed watching them and a shame he had to end.\",\n","       b'Excellent game!!!', b'The best album ever!'], dtype=object), array([15,  4,  6,  1]))\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yhhIUyLkpGs5","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"1ee00ce2-db20-43cd-e878-2a5b9383d158","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1557860339030,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1942,"user":{"displayName":"Michael Sorg","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SEgKX5ssgFM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA7g/ZczybXIXNlM/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"02128442314109013475"}}},"source":["!rm cache/amazon_multilingual_UK*"],"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["rm: cannot remove 'cache/amazon_multilingual_UK*': No such file or directory\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vquX7bDsD5Ye","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":306},"outputId":"6f947949-1fdf-4e6e-fc83-6114c8b5f13e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1557860399007,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1934,"user":{"displayName":"Michael Sorg","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SEgKX5ssgFM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA7g/ZczybXIXNlM/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"02128442314109013475"}}},"source":["!ls -alh cache"],"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["total 12G\n","-rw------- 1 root root 473M May 14 16:50 amazon_multilingual_DE_category.npy\n","-rw------- 1 root root 2.6M May 14 16:50 amazon_multilingual_DE_labels.npy\n","-rw------- 1 root root 609M May 14 18:59 amazon_multilingual_UK_category.npy\n","-rw------- 1 root root  14M May 14 18:59 amazon_multilingual_UK_labels.npy\n","-rw------- 1 root root 2.6G May 14 18:22 amazon_multilingual_US_category.npy\n","-rw------- 1 root root  53M May 14 18:22 amazon_multilingual_US_labels.npy\n","-rw------- 1 root root 563M May 13 16:19 amazon_reviews_multilingual_DE_v1_00.tsv\n","-rw------- 1 root root 231M May 13 16:18 amazon_reviews_multilingual_DE_v1_00.tsv.gz\n","-rw------- 1 root root 821M May 14 14:03 amazon_reviews_multilingual_UK_v1_00.tsv\n","-rw------- 1 root root 334M May 13 16:35 amazon_reviews_multilingual_UK_v1_00.tsv.gz\n","-rw------- 1 root root 3.4G May 13 19:12 amazon_reviews_multilingual_US_v1_00.tsv\n","-rw------- 1 root root 1.4G May 13 16:27 amazon_reviews_multilingual_US_v1_00.tsv.gz\n","-rw------- 1 root root 9.1M May 13 10:18 reviews_Amazon_Instant_Video_5.json.gz\n","-rw------- 1 root root 1.6M May 13 11:17 reviews_Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5.json.gz\n","-rw------- 1 root root 828K May 13 11:18 reviews_Baby_Products_5.json.gz\n","-rw------- 1 root root 1.2G May 13 10:36 reviews_CDs_and_Vinyl.json.gz\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CXoWfIcaEQqk","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## tmp experiments"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ix8jVAChxKtg","colab_type":"code","outputId":"659e6a47-6557-4377-b23f-57dadff1d48f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1557857112932,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":20575,"user":{"displayName":"Michael Sorg","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SEgKX5ssgFM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA7g/ZczybXIXNlM/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"02128442314109013475"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":530}},"source":["frame = getAmazonDataFrame(\"amazon_reviews_multilingual_\" + \"UK\" + \"_v1_00.tsv.gz\")\n","frame.head()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["./cache/amazon_reviews_multilingual_UK_v1_00.tsv already exists.
